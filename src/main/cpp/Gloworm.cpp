Reference: 
PhotonVision documentation: https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/
GlowWorm documentation:     https://gloworm.vision/

I haven't actually written anything here yet (obviously) but hopefully we can just tranfer the code from LimeLight.cpp/.hpp

Update 10/12/21 @12:00PM
The PhotonLib files from documentation are all in the PhotonLib folder with the robot CPP files
I had to do some digging around since all the files in the documentation were for Java and not C++
