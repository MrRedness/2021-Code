**Welcome to Team 1771's (North Gwinnett Robotics) GitHub repo containing code for their Black Widow 2021 Infinite Recharge robot**

*Things to keep in mind while editing code:*
-  If classes are only used once, try making them namespaces
-  Keep public functions & variables declared in .hpp files
-  Private functions and variables should be kept within .cpp files
-  Use snake_styling for variables
-  Use camelCase for functions
-  Use PascalCase for classes & namespaces
-  Constant variables & namespaces containing exclusively constant variables may be ALLUPPERCASE
